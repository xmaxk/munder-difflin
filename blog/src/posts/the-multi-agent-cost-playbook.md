faq:
  - q: "What's the single biggest lever for cutting AI agent costs?"
    a: "Prompt caching, for most agents. An agent re-sends the same large stable prefix — system prompt, tool definitions, project context — on every turn. With caching, that prefix is written once and then read at roughly a tenth of the normal input price, so only the per-turn delta pays full rate. For a long-running agent that's the difference between linear and near-flat context cost."
  - q: "Do these levers stack?"
    a: "Yes, and that's the point. Caching cuts the cost of the repeated prefix, batching halves eligible non-urgent work, model tiering moves the routine majority to a cheap model, context discipline shrinks what each agent carries, and local-first removes the platform fee on top of tokens. They're multiplicative, not either-or — a fleet applies several at once."
  - q: "Does using cheaper models hurt quality?"
    a: "Only if you route the wrong tasks to them. Most agent work is routine and a small model handles it fine; you reserve the frontier model for the genuinely hard minority. The skill is matching task difficulty to model tier — default lean, escalate on signal — not flattening everything onto one model."
  - q: "How does a multi-agent harness help with cost specifically?"
    a: "It gives you the structural levers in one place: per-agent model selection (cheap workers, premium orchestrator), a way to batch non-urgent fleet work, and — if it's local-first — no per-seat platform tax on top of model tokens. You pay for tokens, not for orchestration."

<div class="callout tldr"><span class="ic">TL;DR</span><p>Cost is the quiet tax on multi-agent
systems: one agent's token rate × N agents, each carrying its own context, becomes a real bill fast. The
good news is the biggest levers are mechanical and <strong>compound</strong>. Five of them:
<strong>(1) prompt caching</strong> (reuse the stable prefix at ~a tenth the price),
<strong>(2) batching</strong> (~50% off non-urgent work), <strong>(3) model tiering</strong> (cheap
workers, premium orchestrator), <strong>(4) context discipline</strong> (don't pay to re-read
everything, N times), and <strong>(5) local-first</strong> (no platform tax on top of tokens). Pull all
five and a fleet's bill drops by more than half without losing quality.</p></div>

Two earlier posts covered single levers: [routing the right task to the right
model](/blog/do-more-with-less-model-routing/) and [not paying twice for the same
tokens](/blog/prompt-caching-for-ai-agents/). This is the unified playbook — the **five levers** that
actually move a multi-agent fleet's bill, why they matter more when agents run in parallel, and how they
stack.

Why multi-agent makes cost urgent: a single agent's token rate, multiplied by N agents running at once,
each carrying its **own** context window, adds up fast. The flip side is that the levers are
well-documented and composable — so the same parallelism that grows the bill is what makes disciplined
optimization pay off N times over.

## Lever 1 — Prompt caching: reuse the stable context

The highest-leverage move for most agents, because an agent re-sends a large **stable** prefix every
turn: its system prompt, tool definitions, and project/codebase context. Without caching you re-pay for
all of it on every call.

The mechanics are provider-documented: a cache **write** costs a small premium over base input (on
Anthropic, ~1.25× for the short TTL), and every cache **read** costs roughly **a tenth** of the normal
input price — about a 90% discount on the cached portion. Put the unchanging prefix first, cache it, and
only the per-turn delta pays full rate. For a [long-running agent](/blog/long-running-agents-the-2026-shift/)
that's the difference between linear and near-flat context cost. One caveat worth knowing: caches have a
short time-to-live, so a bursty or idle agent can lose the cache between turns — pacing matters.

## Lever 2 — Batching: trade latency for ~50%

Provider **batch** APIs run requests asynchronously (results within ~24h) for about **50% off** input
and output, with no quality difference — only timing. The agent insight is that a lot of fleet work
isn't latency-sensitive at all: overnight reviews, bulk file analysis, [scheduled
audits](/blog/scheduling-autonomous-agent-missions/). That work is batchable by design. Caching and
batching together stack on eligible workloads for a large combined discount.

## Lever 3 — Model tiering: cheap workers, premium orchestrator

This is the structural multi-agent win. The price spread between a small model and a frontier model is
enormous — on the order of **10–100× per token** — so running every agent on the biggest model is pure
waste. The pattern: **route the routine majority to a cheap model and reserve the frontier model for the
hard minority** (and for the orchestrator that has to reason about the whole job). Most agent work is
routine, so this alone typically cuts spend by more than half without hurting quality. The
[full argument is here](/blog/do-more-with-less-model-routing/).

This is a concrete feature in Munder Difflin, not just advice: the harness's per-agent model selection
(`HarnessConfig.defaultModel` in `src/main/config.ts`) lets you assign a Haiku-class model to worker
agents and an Opus-class model to the GOD orchestrator **today** — the cheap-workers/premium-lead pattern
configured directly.

## Lever 4 — Context discipline: don't pay to re-read everything, N times

The multiplier nobody budgets for: every agent's context window is a **recurring per-turn cost**, and in
a fleet you pay it N times over. Keeping each agent's context **scoped** to only what its task needs,
summarizing or compacting long histories, and not broadcasting full shared state into every agent's
window are direct cost levers — not just hygiene. Cheaper recall is another reason a hive leans on
[compact, markdown-first memory](/blog/markdown-first-agent-memory/) and semantic recall instead of
dragging everything back into context.

## Lever 5 — Local-first: remove the platform tax

The structural one. Cloud agent *platforms* often charge per-seat or orchestration fees **on top of**
the model token cost. A [local-first hive](/blog/why-local-first-matters-for-ai-agents/) pays **only**
for model tokens — the orchestration, the files, the audit log all run on your machine for free. Pair
that with an in-app usage view ([observability](/blog/observability-for-agent-fleets/)) and you can watch
the bill climb in real time and apply levers 1–4 exactly where they bite. Predictable, attributable cost
is part of the local-first case.

## They compound — that's the whole point

These aren't five alternatives; they're five multipliers you apply at once. Cache the stable prefix,
batch the non-urgent work, tier the models, scope the context, and skip the platform tax. Each one bends
the curve, and together they turn "we can't afford a fleet" into "the fleet costs less than the one
over-powered agent it replaced." And remember the real denominator: not cost per token but **cost per
completed task** — because a "cheap per token" agent that needs three retries to finish isn't cheap at
all.

## FAQ

**What's the single biggest lever?** Prompt caching, for most agents — the stable prefix (system prompt,
tools, context) gets written once and read at ~a tenth the price, so only the per-turn delta pays full
rate.

**Do these levers stack?** Yes — they're multiplicative. Caching cuts the repeated prefix, batching
halves eligible non-urgent work, tiering moves the routine majority to a cheap model, context discipline
shrinks each window, and local-first removes the platform fee. A fleet applies several at once.

**Does cheaper hurt quality?** Only if you route the wrong tasks to a small model. Default lean, escalate
the genuinely hard minority — match difficulty to tier rather than flattening everything onto one model.

## The bottom line

A multi-agent fleet doesn't have to be expensive — it has to be *engineered*. The five levers are
mechanical, documented, and compounding: caching, batching, tiering, context discipline, and local-first.
Pull them together and you spend less, run faster, and stop paying frontier prices for routine work.
