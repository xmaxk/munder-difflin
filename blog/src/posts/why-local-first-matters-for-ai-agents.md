faq:
  - q: "What does local-first mean for AI agents?"
    a: "Local-first means the orchestration layer, the agents, and their memory all run on your own machine — not in a vendor's cloud. Your agents still call the model API, but the coordination, files, and stored knowledge stay local."
  - q: "Is local-first more private than cloud agent platforms?"
    a: "Generally yes for everything except the model call itself. Your code, memory, message history, and orchestration never leave your machine, so there's a far smaller surface where your project data could be stored or exposed."

<div class="callout tldr"><span class="ic">TL;DR</span><p><strong>Local-first</strong> means your
agents, their orchestration, and their memory live on <em>your</em> machine — not in a vendor's cloud.
You get more <strong>control</strong> (it's your files and your rules), more <strong>privacy</strong>
(code and memory don't leave the box), and more predictable <strong>cost</strong> (no per-seat
platform fees on top of model usage). For AI agents that touch your whole codebase, that's not a
detail — it's the foundation.</p></div>

When people evaluate multi-agent tools, they fixate on features and skip the question that quietly
shapes everything: *where does this actually run?* For agents that read and edit your entire
codebase, the answer matters more than any single feature.

## What "local-first" actually means

Local-first doesn't mean "no internet." Your agents still call the model — that request goes to
Anthropic the same way your editor's does. Local-first is about *where the rest lives*:

- the **orchestration** that routes work between agents,
- the **files** the agents read and write,
- the **memory** the team accumulates, and
- the **message history** and event log of what happened.

In a [local-first setup](/#why), all of that stays on your machine. In a cloud platform, much of it
lives on someone else's servers. Same agents, very different trust model.

## Three reasons it matters

### 1. Control — it's your machine, your rules
Local agents work against your real working tree, your git, your environment, your tools. Nothing is
mediated by a platform's sandbox or subject to its outages, rate limits, or deprecations. When the
team is local, *you* own the failure modes — and you can fix them.

### 2. Privacy — your code and memory don't leave the box
Agents that touch your whole repo accumulate a lot of context: source, secrets-adjacent config,
internal docs, and a [memory store](/blog/give-claude-code-long-term-memory/) full of your project's
hard-won knowledge. Keeping orchestration and memory local means there's no third party storing your
codebase's working notes. For client work, regulated environments, or just good hygiene, that's a real
advantage.

### 3. Cost — predictable, without a platform tax
Cloud agent platforms typically charge per seat or per run *on top of* your model usage. Local-first
adds no platform tax — you pay for the model calls you'd make anyway. As you scale from a couple of
agents to a team, that difference compounds.

## What you give up in the cloud

It's only fair to name the trade. Cloud platforms can offer zero-setup onboarding, managed scaling,
and team features out of the box. If you need a hosted, shared, always-on service for a distributed
team, that convenience is real. The same trade shows up in personal assistants, as our look at [Grok Bot alternatives](/blog/grok-bot-alternatives/) shows.

But for an individual developer or a small team running agents against their own code, the
convenience rarely outweighs handing over control, privacy, and predictable cost. You can have the
coordination *and* keep it local.

## Local-first doesn't mean uncoordinated

The old assumption was that local meant primitive — a few terminals, no shared brain. That's no longer
true. A [local multi-agent harness](/#what) gives you the full coordination layer — shared memory,
inter-agent messaging, an orchestrator, a visual floor — entirely on your machine. You don't trade
coordination for control; you get both.

That's the bet behind [running an office of AI agents](/blog/run-an-office-of-ai-agents/) locally, and
it's why the [shift from one terminal to a team](/blog/from-one-terminal-to-a-team/) doesn't require
moving to the cloud.

## The bottom line

For agents that live inside your codebase, *where it runs* is a first-class feature. Local-first buys
control, privacy, and predictable cost — and modern tooling means you no longer sacrifice coordination
to get them.
