faq:
  - q: "Can you trigger AI agents from Slack?"
    a: "Yes. Munder Difflin can run a small local webhook that listens to a Slack channel and turns each message into a task in the orchestrator's queue. You type in Slack, and an agent picks the work up — without opening the app or sitting at your machine."
  - q: "Is a Slack-to-agent webhook secure?"
    a: "It's built to be. Every request is verified with an HMAC over the raw body using your Slack signing secret, compared in constant time, with a five-minute replay-timestamp guard and a body-size cap checked before anything else. Anything that fails gets a 403. The local handler is the security boundary, not the public tunnel."
  - q: "Do I need to host a public server to trigger agents from Slack?"
    a: "No. The webhook runs on your own machine. A best-effort local tunnel gives Slack a public URL to reach that local port, so there's nothing to deploy or keep online — and if the tunnel can't start, your local handler still runs."

<div class="callout tldr"><span class="ic">TL;DR</span><p>Munder Difflin v0.1.7 can <strong>trigger your
agent hive from Slack</strong>: a tiny local webhook listens to a channel, <strong>verifies every
request</strong> with your Slack signing secret (HMAC + replay guard, 403 on anything suspicious), and
drops the message into the orchestrator's queue as a task. The server runs <em>on your machine</em>; a
best-effort tunnel just gives Slack a doorbell to ring. You get a remote trigger for a local-first hive
— start work from your phone, no servers to host.</p></div>

Most of the time you drive your agents from the app. But sometimes the work starts somewhere else — a
teammate drops a request in a channel, or you're away from your desk and want to kick off a long run
from your phone. Munder Difflin's Slack integration (shipped in v0.1.7) closes that gap: a message in a
watched Slack channel becomes a task in your hive's queue. Here's how it works, and why it stays true
to a local-first design.

## What "trigger from Slack" actually does

The flow is one sentence: a message in a Slack channel you've connected becomes an item in
[the orchestrator's](/blog/how-the-god-orchestrator-works/) queue, exactly like a task you'd type
yourself. The orchestrator then triages and routes it to the right agent like any other piece of work.

It's worth naming the direction. This is **inbound** — the outside world asking your hive to *do*
something. It's the mirror image of [human-in-the-loop
approvals](/blog/human-in-the-loop-approving-ai-agents/), where an agent reaches *out* to a person for a
decision. One is how you start work remotely; the other is how agents check with you mid-run. Together
they let a hive run while you're not at the keyboard.

## The architecture: a tiny local webhook

The integration is deliberately small. There's no `@slack/bolt`, no framework — just a bare
`node:http` server running inside the app's main process that implements *only* the slice of Slack's
Events API it needs. It does three things: answer Slack's one-time `url_verification` handshake, verify
incoming events, and hand the accepted message text to the app.

Because the server lives on your machine, Slack needs a way to reach it. The integration opens a
best-effort **local tunnel** and hands you a public URL to paste into your Slack app's *Event
Subscriptions → Request URL*. That tunnel is just a doorbell: it forwards Slack's POSTs to your local
port. If it can't be established, the local handler stays up anyway — the tunnel is a convenience, not
the security boundary.

## Security: verify everything before you trust it

A webhook that can enqueue work for autonomous agents is exactly the kind of endpoint you don't want
strangers poking. So the handler treats every request as hostile until proven otherwise:

- **Signature check.** Each request is verified with an **HMAC** over the *raw* body, keyed by your
  Slack **signing secret**, and compared in **constant time** (so a wrong guess leaks no timing
  information). No valid signature, no entry.
- **Replay guard.** Slack stamps each request with a timestamp; anything more than **five minutes** off
  is rejected, so a captured request can't be replayed later.
- **Size cap first.** The body is capped (1 MB) *before* the signature is computed, so an
  unauthenticated peer can't force unbounded memory use just by sending a huge payload.
- **Fail closed.** Any failure — bad signature, stale timestamp, oversized body — returns a flat
  **403**. There's no partial trust.

The secret itself stays local and is never logged. The principle is the one every trust boundary should
follow: authenticate at the edge, fail closed, and keep the verification cheap and constant-time.

## From Slack message to agent task

Once a `message` event passes verification, the handler does something refreshingly boring: it strips a
leading bot mention from the text and hands the clean string to the app, which drops it into
**Michael's queue** — the orchestrator's inbox. From there it's just another task: the orchestrator
reads it, decides who should handle it, and dispatches, the same way it handles work that arrives
through [the hive's normal message routing](/blog/coordinating-ai-coding-agents/).

You can scope what counts, too. An optional **channel filter** means only messages from one specific
channel are accepted; events from anywhere else are dropped before they ever reach the queue. That
keeps a noisy workspace from turning into a noisy hive.

## Setting it up

The moving parts are minimal. In the app you enable Slack and paste your **signing secret** (from your
Slack app's *Basic Information*). Optionally set a **channel id** to listen to just one channel, and a
**port** if 3847 (the default) is taken. Start it, copy the tunnel URL into Slack's *Event
Subscriptions → Request URL*, and Slack's verification handshake confirms the connection. After that,
messages in the channel flow straight into your queue.

## Why this fits a local-first hive

It would have been easier to host this in a cloud function. Doing it as a local webhook is the point.
Your agents, their memory, and their git history never leave your machine — Slack is only a *trigger*,
a thin remote surface for starting and watching work. There's nothing to deploy, nothing to pay for,
and no third party sitting in the path between a message and your code. It's the same philosophy behind
[local-first orchestration](/blog/local-first-ai-agent-orchestration/): keep the control plane on your
box, and let the outside world knock politely at the door.

Pair it with [scheduled missions](/blog/scheduling-autonomous-agent-missions/) and the picture rounds
out: timers put recurring work into the queue, Slack puts ad-hoc work into the queue, and the
orchestrator runs both — whether or not you're watching.

## FAQ

**Can you trigger AI agents from Slack?** Yes — a local webhook listens to a channel and turns each
message into a task in the orchestrator's queue, so an agent picks up the work without you opening the
app.

**Is the Slack webhook secure?** Every request is HMAC-verified against your signing secret in constant
time, with a five-minute replay guard and a body-size cap checked first; anything suspicious gets a 403,
and the secret is never logged.

**Do I need a public server?** No. The webhook runs locally and a best-effort tunnel gives Slack a URL
to reach it — nothing to host, and the local handler runs even if the tunnel doesn't.
