<div class="callout tldr"><span class="ic">TL;DR</span><p>This is the full, working setup for driving your
<strong>Munder Difflin</strong> hive from Slack. Create a Slack app, add three bot scopes

Munder Difflin runs a virtual office of AI agents on your own machine. Most days you drive that office
from the desktop app. But the request often starts somewhere else — a teammate asks in a channel, or
you're away from your desk and want to kick off a run from your phone. The Slack integration closes that
gap: **@mention your bot in Slack, and the message becomes work for your hive.** When the task finishes,
a summary posts straight back into the same thread.

This is a complete how-to for the setup that's live right now. It has two halves: the Slack app side
(api.slack.com), and the Munder Difflin side (Settings). Do them in order and you'll be triggering
agents from chat in about ten minutes.

## What you're building

A message that @mentions your bot in a connected Slack channel becomes a task in
[the orchestrator's](/blog/how-the-god-orchestrator-works/) queue — exactly like a task you'd type into
the app yourself. GOD then triages it and routes it to the right agent. Two things make this feel
conversational rather than fire-and-forget:

- **Thread activation.** The first @mention in a thread "activates" it. After that, you can keep replying
  in that same thread *without* re-mentioning the bot, and the hive keeps listening. It's a real
  back-and-forth, not a one-shot command.
- **Done-summaries.** When the work lands, the office posts a summary reply **in the same thread** via
  Slack's `chat.postMessage`. You see the result where you asked the question.

It also reads **file and image attachments** — drop a screenshot or a log file alongside your @mention
and the hive ingests it.

Under the hood there's no `@slack/bolt`, no framework, and nothing hosted in the cloud. A tiny
`node:http` server inside the app implements just the slice of Slack's **Events API** it needs, and a
local tunnel gives Slack a public doorbell to ring. Your agents, their memory, and your code never leave
your machine.

## Part 1 — Create the Slack app

Head to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app **from scratch**, in the
workspace you want the bot to live in.

You'll collect two secrets and set three scopes. Here's exactly where each lives.

### Signing Secret

In your app's left nav, open **Basic Information** and find **App Credentials**. Copy the **Signing
Secret**. This is what Munder Difflin uses to verify that every inbound request is genuinely from Slack —
it never leaves your machine and is never logged.

### Bot Token Scopes

Open **OAuth & Permissions → Scopes → Bot Token Scopes** and add these three:

- **`chat:write`** — lets the bot post replies, including the done-summary, back into the thread.
- **`channels:history`** — lets Slack deliver message and thread-reply events from **public** channels.
- **`groups:history`** — the same, for **private** channels.

You don't need anything beyond these three. The hive learns its own bot user id automatically from each
event, so there's no extra scope just to detect mentions.

### Install and grab the Bot User OAuth Token

Still on **OAuth & Permissions**, click **Install to Workspace** and approve. Slack then shows a **Bot
User OAuth Token** that starts with **`xoxb-`** — copy it. That token authorizes the bot's replies; like
the signing secret, it stays in the app's main process and is never logged.

> Keep both values handy. You'll paste them into Munder Difflin next, then come back to finish Event
> Subscriptions.

## Part 2 — Configure Munder Difflin

Open Munder Difflin and go to **Settings**. In the Slack section:

1. **Enable Slack.**
2. Paste the **Signing Secret**.
3. Paste the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-…`).
4. *(Optional)* Set a **Channel ID** to restrict ingestion to a single channel. Leave it blank to accept
   any channel the bot is in. This is the cleanest way to keep a noisy workspace from turning into a
   noisy hive.
5. *(Optional)* Change the **port** if `3847` (the default) is already taken on your machine.

Start it. The app binds the local webhook server and opens a public tunnel, then shows you a **Request
URL** — the public address Slack will call. Copy that URL; you need it for the last step.

If the tunnel can't start, the app surfaces a real error rather than handing you a dead URL. The local
handler is the security boundary, so it stays up regardless — but you do need a working tunnel URL for
Slack to reach it.

## Part 3 — Point Slack at your Request URL

Back in your Slack app, open **Event Subscriptions** and toggle **Enable Events** on.

Paste the **Request URL** from Munder Difflin into the **Request URL** field. Slack immediately fires a
one-time `url_verification` handshake at it; the app answers the challenge and Slack shows a green
**Verified**. (If it doesn't verify, jump to the troubleshooting note below — it's almost always the
tunnel.)

Now scroll to **Subscribe to bot events** and add:

- **`app_mention`** — fires when someone @mentions the bot. This is the primary trigger.
- **`message.channels`** — message events in public channels (for **thread replies** in an activated
  thread, and **file_share** uploads).
- **`message.groups`** — the same, for private channels.

**Save changes.** Slack may prompt you to reinstall the app to apply the new event subscriptions — do it.

That's the whole loop. The hive triggers on:

- a direct **@mention** of the bot in a connected channel,
- any **reply inside a thread** the bot was already mentioned in (no re-mention needed),
- a **file or image upload** that @mentions the bot.

It deliberately ignores the bot's own posts, edits, channel-join notices, and every other message
subtype — so it never talks to itself and never reacts to channel noise.

## Try it

In a channel where the bot is a member, type something like:

> @YourBot summarize the open PRs in the api repo and flag anything stale

The message lands in the queue, GOD routes it, and an agent picks it up. Keep the conversation going by
replying in that same thread — the hive is still listening. When the task is done, a summary appears
right there in the thread.

## Troubleshooting: the Request URL rotates on restart

Here's the one quirk worth tattooing on the back of your hand. **The public Request URL comes from an
ephemeral tunnel, and it changes every time the app restarts.** So if Slack suddenly stops triggering
your agents — verification was green yesterday, silence today — it's almost always because the app was
restarted and the old URL went stale.

The fix is quick:

1. **Stop and Start** Munder Difflin's Slack integration (or just relaunch the app).
2. Copy the **new Request URL** it shows you.
3. Paste it back into Slack's **Event Subscriptions → Request URL** and let it re-verify.

Triggers resume the moment Slack shows **Verified** again. If you find yourself doing this a lot, get
into the habit of re-checking the Request URL whenever you restart — it's the single most common reason
Slack triggering "breaks."

## Why it's built this way

It would have been easier to host this in a cloud function. Doing it as a **local** webhook is the
point. Every request is HMAC-verified against your signing secret in constant time, with a five-minute
replay guard and a size cap checked first — anything suspicious gets a flat 403. The secrets stay on
your box. Slack is only a thin remote surface for *starting and watching* work; the office itself —
agents, memory, git history — never leaves your machine. It's the same
[local-first philosophy](/blog/local-first-ai-agent-orchestration/) behind everything Munder Difflin
does: keep the control plane on your computer, and let the outside world knock politely at the door.

Pair it with [scheduled missions](/blog/scheduling-autonomous-agent-missions/) and the picture rounds
out: timers put recurring work into the queue, Slack puts ad-hoc work into the queue, and your office
runs both — whether or not you're watching.

## FAQ

**How do I connect Slack to Munder Difflin?** Create a Slack app, add the `chat:write`,
`channels:history`, and `groups:history` bot scopes, install it, then paste the Signing Secret and
`xoxb-` Bot User OAuth Token into Settings. Copy the app's Request URL into Slack's Event Subscriptions,
subscribe to `app_mention` + message events, and @mention the bot to start work.

**Which scopes does it need?** Just three: `chat:write` for replies and done-summaries,
`channels:history` and `groups:history` so Slack delivers the message and thread-reply events the hive
listens to.

**Why did Slack stop triggering?** The Request URL is from an ephemeral tunnel that rotates on restart.
Relaunch the app, copy the new URL, and re-paste it into Event Subscriptions.
