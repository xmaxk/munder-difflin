faq:
  - q: "Which agent engines can Munder Difflin run on one floor?"
    a: "Seven CLI engines plus a local provider: Claude Code, Antigravity (Gemini), OpenAI Codex, OpenCode, Crush, pi.dev, and GitHub Copilot CLI, which joined in v0.3.3 as the first community-contributed engine. You pick the engine per hire from a visual picker in Add Agent, and they all participate in the same hive on the same office floor."
  - q: "Can any engine be the GOD orchestrator?"
    a: "Michael's engine is swappable from onboarding or a change-engine flow, and OpenCode, Crush, and pi.dev are god-eligible alongside Claude Code, Antigravity, and Codex. Claude Code is the strongest default because it has the native hook bridge and the deepest hive integration. Copilot CLI is a worker-only engine: its print mode exits per turn, so it can't run the floor."
  - q: "Where do API keys and local model endpoints go?"
    a: "Settings -> AI Engines. Per-provider keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter, Groq) are stored write-only in the encrypted secret broker — they're never read back into the renderer and are materialized main-only at spawn. The same panel holds per-engine local base-URLs for Ollama, LM Studio, or vLLM, plus default-model fields that OpenCode, Crush, and pi.dev pick up when they spawn."
  - q: "How do I run some desks on local or open-source models?"
    a: "Hire a worker on a local-capable engine — OpenCode, Crush, or pi.dev — and the Add Agent modal surfaces curated OSS-model quick-picks: a Local bucket of Mac-runnable Ollama tags (gpt-oss, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1, Mistral Small, Llama 3.3 70B) and a BYOK bucket via Groq or OpenRouter. Clicking one fills the engine-correct model slug and rebuilds the spawn command for you."
  - q: "Why is GitHub Copilot CLI limited to dispatched tasks?"
    a: "Copilot CLI runs in its documented non-interactive print mode (copilot -p), which exits after each turn and exposes no hook bridge. That means Copilot workers can't drain hive inbox mail — routed messages bounce to the GOD orchestrator instead of silently dropping. They're excellent for self-contained dispatched work, and they authenticate with your existing GitHub Copilot login, no new keys."
  - q: "What happens if a chosen engine's CLI isn't installed?"
    a: "The harness self-heals: it runs that engine's installer in the terminal, then automatically restarts and continues into the freshly installed binary in place. There's no dead-end and no manual step, and the flow is idempotent so the installer never fires twice."

<div class="callout tldr"><span class="ic">TL;DR</span><p>You don't have to pick one agent CLI. Munder Difflin runs <strong>seven engines on one floor</strong> — Claude Code, Antigravity, Codex, OpenCode, Crush, pi.dev, and GitHub Copilot CLI — chosen <strong>per hire</strong> from a visual picker. The winning layout: <strong>Claude Code as the GOD orchestrator</strong> and hive-aware senior workers, <strong>Codex for coding bursts</strong>, <strong>Copilot for dispatched, self-contained tasks</strong>, and <strong>OpenCode / Crush / pi.dev on BYOK keys or local models</strong> for the routine majority. Keys and local endpoints live in <strong>Settings → AI Engines</strong>; OSS-model quick-picks fill the right slug for you.</p></div>

Most multi-agent setups are a clone army: five copies of the same CLI on the same model, paying the same rate for wildly different jobs. That's like staffing an office entirely with regional managers. A real office has a manager, a couple of closers, and a lot of people doing solid routine work at a sensible salary.

Munder Difflin is built for that second shape. Every hire — and Michael, the [GOD orchestrator](/blog/how-the-god-orchestrator-works/) himself — runs on a pluggable engine, picked from a visual provider picker at hire time. Here's how to lay out the floor.

## The engine roster, honestly

Seven engines can sit on one floor today, and they're not interchangeable — that's the point:

- **Claude Code** — the deepest hive citizen. Native hooks drive lifecycle events, inbox draining, HITL gates, and mid-run steering. The natural orchestrator.
- **Antigravity (Gemini)** — full hive participation via the native `agy-hook` bridge.
- **OpenAI Codex** — receives the hive protocol as its initial prompt and participates through inbox/outbox routing. A strong pure-coding worker. New to it? Start with [how to install Codex CLI](/blog/how-to-install-codex-cli/).
- **OpenCode, Crush, pi.dev** — the BYOK trio (shipped in v0.3.1), wired in via native-plugin, proxy, and hooks bridges respectively. Each works as a worker *and* as Michael, and each can point at your own keys or a local model.
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** — new in [v0.3.3](/blog/launching-munder-difflin-v0-3-3/), the first community-contributed engine (PR #101). Runs in documented print mode (`copilot -p`) with a model picker and `--resume`, authenticated by your existing Copilot login.

One honest caveat up front: Copilot's print mode exits per turn and has no hook bridge, so its workers can't drain hive inbox mail — routed mail bounces to the orchestrator instead of disappearing. That's by design, and it tells you exactly where Copilot desks belong.

## The layout that works

**Michael's office: Claude Code.** The orchestrator reads every request, adjudicates traffic, scribes the blackboard, and escalates only critical items to you. That's sustained, stateful, judgment-heavy work — give it the engine with native hooks and the tightest harness integration. (Michael's engine is swappable from onboarding or the change-engine flow if you want to experiment; OpenCode, Crush, and pi.dev are all god-eligible, backstopped by a provider-agnostic idle fallback.)

**Senior desks: Claude Code or Antigravity, hive-aware.** Work that involves conversation — replying to routed messages, coordinating with other agents, long multi-step missions — needs engines that drain a mailbox. These are your closers.

**Coding bursts: Codex.** Scoped, well-defined implementation work — "build this component, tests included" — plays to Codex's strengths. It gets the protocol injected as its initial prompt and reports back through outbox routing.

**Dispatched tasks: Copilot CLI.** Self-contained jobs that arrive, execute, and finish — perfect for print mode. Hire a Copilot worker, pick its model (Claude Sonnet 4.5 by default, GPT-5.4, or auto), and dispatch. No new keys; your existing GitHub Copilot seat covers it.

**The routine majority: OpenCode, Crush, or pi.dev on cheap or local models.** Formatting passes, doc updates, changelog grooming, triage — most fleet work doesn't need frontier reasoning, and this is where the money is. This is [capability routing](/blog/do-more-with-less-model-routing/) made physical: the desk itself is the routing decision.

## Wiring it: Settings → AI Engines

All the credentials for the BYOK trio live in one panel. **Settings → AI Engines** collects per-provider API keys — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter, Groq — stored **write-only** in the encrypted secret broker. They're never read back into the renderer; the main process materializes them into the environment only at spawn. The same panel takes per-engine **local base-URLs** (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM) and default-model fields, which OpenCode, Crush, and pi.dev pick up automatically.

Then hire. In Add Agent, choosing a local-capable engine surfaces **OSS-model quick-picks**: a *Local* bucket of Mac-runnable Ollama tags (gpt-oss 20B/120B, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1, Mistral Small, Llama 3.3 70B) and a *third-party OSS provider* bucket via Groq or OpenRouter. Click one and it fills the engine-correct slug — `local/<tag>` for OpenCode, `ollama/<tag>` for Crush and pi — and rebuilds the spawn command. If the engine's CLI binary is missing, the harness runs its installer in the terminal and auto restart-and-continues into the fresh binary. No dead-ends.

## Keeping the mixed floor affordable and sane

A mixed floor is a cost instrument, but only if you can see and cap what each desk spends. Munder Difflin gives every agent a **token budget** with live fleet monitoring, real token and cost telemetry per agent per session, and a **circuit breaker** that steers, constrains, then stops any agent that loops or blows its budget. The expensive Claude Code desks carry tight scopes; the local desks can grind all night for electricity. The routing logic — which work deserves which price — is the whole subject of [the multi-agent cost playbook](/blog/the-multi-agent-cost-playbook/).

Isolation keeps them from colliding: each hire gets its own pseudo-terminal and, with the git-isolation toggle, its own worktree — seven engines, zero branch fights.

## Start with three desks

Don't design the org chart up front. Hire Claude Code as Michael, add one Codex or Copilot desk for a real coding task, and one OpenCode desk on a Groq or Ollama model for something routine. Watch what each engine is actually good at on *your* work, then grow the floor around the evidence.
