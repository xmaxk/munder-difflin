/**
 * Release gate: every download link we advertise must actually resolve.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. RELEASE.md is published verbatim as the GitHub release body,
 * and its download table links to
 * `/releases/latest/download/Munder-Difflin-<version>-<platform>.<ext>`. That URL
 * form requires the EXACT filename present in whichever release is currently
 * "latest", and electron-builder bakes ${version} into every artifact name — so a
 * version string left behind in RELEASE.md turns all four download links into
 * hard 404s the moment the next release ships.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. The table sat pinned at 0.3.2 from v0.3.4 through
 * v0.3.7, and mac DMG downloads fell from 118 and 76 on v0.3.2/v0.3.3 to single
 * digits on every release after. Nothing failed, nothing warned; the release
 * simply stopped being installable for anyone arriving through GitHub, and the
 * page even claimed the opposite ("stays correct across versions").
 *
 * Two modes:
 *   (default) offline — every advertised version string matches package.json,
 *             except the website fallback, which may be newer (see rule 3).
 *             Run this BEFORE tagging, when the assets do not exist yet.
 *   --live    also HEADs each URL and requires 200. Run this AFTER publishing
 *             the release, which is the only moment the answer is meaningful.
