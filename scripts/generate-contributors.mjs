Everyone on this list has code in Munder Difflin. If that is you, this file is yours to point at.

It is generated from the pull requests themselves rather than from commit metadata, so nobody is
dropped because their git email does not happen to match their GitHub account. It is regenerated
from merged pull requests, so you appear without having to ask.

**${list.length} people** have contributed so far.

<a href="https://github.com/${REPO}/graphs/contributors">
  <img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=${REPO}" alt="Contributor avatars">
</a>

The avatars above come from GitHub's own contributors graph, and that graph is not this list.
GitHub files each commit under the email address in its author field, so anyone whose git email is
not attached to their GitHub account is left out of that graph. Nothing warns them and nothing
warns us. Some addresses can never be attached at all, because they point at a local machine name
rather than a real domain. The table below is the list to go by. It is built from merged pull
requests, and a pull request always has a real account behind it.

| Contributor | Contributions | First | Most recent |
|---|---:|---|---|
${list.map(row).join('\n')}

_${plural(list.reduce((n, p) => n + total(p), 0))} from ${list.length} people._

## † Contributions that never got the merged badge

${landed.length} pull requests below are in main and their authors are contributors, but GitHub
shows them as closed rather than merged. On release night the pull requests were closed before the
release branch merged into main, so at the moment they closed, main did not contain their commits
yet. GitHub records the badge at that instant and will not let it be changed afterwards. It was our
sequencing mistake and it is not recoverable, so the record lives here instead. The full account is
in [discussion #353](https://github.com/${REPO}/discussions/353).

Every commit listed here was checked to be in \`main\` before it was added.

| Pull request | Contributor | In main |
|---|---|---|
${landed.map((e) => `| [#${e.pr}](https://github.com/${REPO}/pull/${e.pr}) | [@${e.login}](${e.url}) | ${e.commits.map(commitLink).join(', ')} |`).join('\n')}

${landed.filter((e) => e.note).map((e) => `**#${e.pr}** ${e.note}`).join('\n\n')}

**Not on this list yet?** [\`good first issue\`](https://github.com/${REPO}/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
is kept stocked with small, self contained work, and [\`CONTRIBUTING.md\`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) has
everything else. Help that is not code counts too: a bug report with a clean reproduction is often
worth more than a patch, it just cannot be counted automatically here.
