 * (#55) Build the single pre-escaped command-line STRING for routing a non-.exe
 * Windows target through cmd.exe. Returns the args portion only (everything after
 * `cmd.exe`), in Node's canonical `child_process` form:
 *
 *   /d /s /c "<target> <arg> <arg> ..."
 *
 * Each token (the resolved target + every user arg) is double-quoted only when it
 * contains a space/tab/quote, then the WHOLE inner command is wrapped in one more
 * outer quote pair. cmd.exe's `/s` strips exactly that outer pair and executes the
 * remainder literally, so a `C:\Program Files\...` target survives its space.
 *
 * This is handed to `pty.spawn(file, args, ...)` as a STRING, which node-pty treats
 * as a pre-escaped CommandLine and passes through VERBATIM (no per-arg re-escaping),
 * so the quoting here is never double-wrapped.
 *
 * ⚠️ LAST-RESORT PATH — DO NOT PUT AN AGENT PROMPT THROUGH IT. Two hard limits of
 * cmd.exe's parser that no amount of escaping here can work around:
 *
 *  1. **cmd.exe has NO backslash escape.** An earlier version of this comment
 *     claimed `\"` was "cmd's quote-escape". It is not: to cmd, `\` is an ordinary
 *     character and every `"` TOGGLES quote state. So `\"` does not embed a quote —
 *     it closes (or opens) the quoted run and dumps everything after it back into
 *     bare, metacharacter-interpreting context. The `\"` produced below survives
 *     only because the CRT of the *final* program un-escapes it; the intermediate
 *     cmd.exe still mis-tracks quote state across it.
 *  2. **A newline can never survive.** cmd.exe treats CR/LF as a statement
 *     separator before quoting is even considered, so a multi-line argument is
 *     TRUNCATED at its first newline and the remainder is executed as commands.
 *     That is exactly how the Windows hive protocol prompt (multi-line, full of
 *     `(`/`)` which cmd reads as block delimiters) was being destroyed: the agent
 *     booted looking healthy but never received the HIVE PROTOCOL block, so it
 *     never knew its inbox/outbox existed and no agent could message another.
 *
 * There is also cmd.exe's ~8191-character command-line ceiling, which the injected
 * hive prompt (~6.1k chars) sits uncomfortably close to.
 *
 * Prompt-carrying spawns therefore go through `parseNpmCmdShim` instead (spawn the
 * shim's real interpreter with an ARRAY of args, so node-pty's own CRT-correct
 * `argsToCommandLine` runs and no shell parser is involved). This function remains
 * the fallback for every target we cannot decode — strictly no worse than before.

 * path and its CONTENT so it is unit-testable on macOS/Linux, where every Windows
 * build is authored.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. On Windows a `.cmd`/`.bat` cannot be handed to CreateProcess,
 * so the spawn path used to route it through `cmd.exe /d /s /c "<line>"`. That
 * turns argv into a single string parsed by cmd.exe — which cannot carry a newline
 * (statement separator), reads `(`/`)` as block delimiters, has no backslash escape,
 * and caps out near 8191 chars. The hive protocol prompt is a ~6.1k-char, 11-line,
 * 62-paren argument, so on Windows it was truncated at its first newline: every
 * npm-installed CLI (OpenCode always; `claude.cmd` whenever there is no native
 * `claude.exe`) started up looking perfectly healthy but never received the HIVE
 * PROTOCOL block, never learned that `inbox/`/`outbox/` existed, and so no agent
 * ever heard from another. Claude appeared to work only because its native
 * `claude.exe` skipped cmd.exe entirely.
 *
 * Spawning the shim's own interpreter with an ARRAY of args removes cmd.exe from
 * the picture: node-pty's `argsToCommandLine` applies MSDN/CRT escaping (backslash
 * doubling before a quote, whole-arg quoting on whitespace) and hands the result
 * straight to CreateProcess, which passes the raw command line to the child. A
 * newline inside a quoted CRT argument is just a character there, and the limit
 * becomes CreateProcess's 32767 rather than cmd's 8191.
 *
 * SHAPES HANDLED (npm's cmd-shim, across its historical revisions; pnpm/yarn emit
 * the same families):
 *
 *   modern (cmd-shim ≥4 / npm ≥7) — dp0 captured into a variable, program chosen
 *   into %_prog%, single trailing exec line:
 *       SET dp0=%~dp0
 *       IF EXIST "%dp0%\node.exe" ( SET "_prog=%dp0%\node.exe" ) ELSE ( SET "_prog=node" … )
 *       endLocal & goto #_undefined_# 2>NUL || title %COMSPEC% & "%_prog%"  "%dp0%\node_modules\pkg\bin\cli.js" %*
 *
 *   classic (cmd-shim 2/3, npm 5/6) — IF/ELSE with the exec inlined in both arms:
 *       @IF EXIST "%~dp0\node.exe" (
 *         "%~dp0\node.exe"  "%~dp0\node_modules\pkg\bin\cli.js" %*
 *       ) ELSE ( … node  "%~dp0\node_modules\pkg\bin\cli.js" %* )
 *
 *   ancient single-line:
 *       @"%~dp0\node.exe"  "%~dp0\node_modules\pkg\bin\cli.js" %*
 *
 * The interpreter is returned BARE (`node`), not as the shim's `%dp0%\node.exe`
 * candidate, on purpose: that candidate only exists for an npm install that ships a
 * colocated node, and that directory is on PATH by construction — so resolving the
 * bare name finds the same binary while also going through the caller's existing
 * PATH/candidate-dir resolution and cache.
 *
 * Returns null — meaning "fall back to the cmd.exe path" — for ANY shape that is
 * not fully understood: unknown interpreter, unexpanded `%VAR%` left in the target,
 * a relative target, extra interpreter flags we would otherwise silently drop, a
 * non-JS target, a file too large to be a shim, or plain garbage.
